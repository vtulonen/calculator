My take on a calculator web app from the Odin Project webdev101 course.

*****************************************************************************

 Thougths after completing:

	It works! As my first "bigger" JS project, I feel like it could've
	been done easier, especially the calculate() function and the way
	I've structured the code could be way more optimized, but for now
	I'm happy with it.
